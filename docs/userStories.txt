Our client - Social Worker/Social Services

Name - Something Connect

user - social worker
- As a social worker I want to manage my cases and client schedules to feel more organized on a daily basis
- After login, I am able to see my Dashboard which provides a visual snapshot of what clients, appointments, and tasks I have for the day.
- From the dashboard I am able to access my calendar and client list.
- I am also able to access an internal chat from my dashboard???
- I am able to intake an individual, fill out intake form with the following: name, address/location, contact info, dependents, need for housing and other resources. 
- Data will then be stored once intake form is submitted.
- Once I am made aware of required resources, I can access a resource library to research and provide client with appropriate resources
- I am able to filter through the resource library based on resource type and filtered using a drop down menu.
- Based on resources provided, confirmed appointments can be added to my calendar (Return to dashboard to add appointments)
- I can view and add client appointments on the client file page.
