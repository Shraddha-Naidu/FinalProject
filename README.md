CLIENT CONNECT
============

Client Connect was created with social workers in mind and how to simplify their their workload by creating an app that allows them to consolidate client/resource tracking. Client connect allows a user to intake clients and track their resources as needed. It also allows the user to track activities related to each client and schedule it into a calendar. With the understanding that each client will have unique needs, the user is also able to keep updates on each client as well as their status within the system. Client connect will easily allow the user to stay organized and help relieve the pressure of requiring multiple files.
